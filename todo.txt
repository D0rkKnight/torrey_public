SAH search space should be based on centroids, not total extents

Test Suite Setup
1. Get some basic tests running (way to incrementally dev these complex algorithms)

BVH optimization
1. Use std::nth_element or std::partition for BVH construction
    - BVH completeness tests (making sure that outcome is fully represented)
    - Partition correctness tests
2. SAH (with binary branching and single child leaves)
    - Independent SAH algorithm
    - SAH correctness test
3. Multi-child leaves
4. n-ary branching
5. Flatten BVH memory representation
6. Prefer closer bounding boxes
7. Sort by center rather than minimum corner

Note: should make this in a test space first I reckon
Just link in from the hw? should work fine

Other optimizations:
1. reorder shape elements in subrange rather than duping
